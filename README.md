# Intune-Registry-Scripts

These are a collection of scripts I am using in Intune to solve problems in relation to security recommendations in WDATP now called MSDE
They are available as is but they work fine on a test tenant.

Test tenant is very small about 10 Windows 10 PCs max with two joined via autopilot and the rest registered (BYOD) personal managed MDM.
Im more interested in roaming devices at this stage rather than full corporate managed desktops which are normally managed via GP

Help yourself if you are learning as this is where I started.

These scripts are designed to work in Microsoft Endpoint Manager to configure registered or joined computers managed by MDM
All prerequisites as described by Microsoft are required.
