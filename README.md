# Intune-Registry-Scripts

These are a collection of scripts I am using in Intune to solve problems in relation to security recommendations in WDATP
They are available as is but they work mainly fine
These scripts do not include ADMX Solutions I am using but if you want a good place to start do a search on Firefox.

Help yourself if you are learning as this is where I started.

These scripts are designed to work in Microsoft Endpoint Manager to configure registered or joined computers managed by MDM
All prerequisites as described by Microsoft are required.
